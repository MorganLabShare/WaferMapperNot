WaferMapper is a set of Matlab scripts originally developed by Ken Hayworth to direct a scanning electron microscope to 
image of libraries of ultrathin sections cut with is automatic tape collecting microtome (ATUM). Josh Morgan and others 
in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman contributed to the further development of this code (see Hayworth et. al. 2016, 
Imaging ATUM ultrathin section libraries with WaferMapper: a multi-scale approach to EM reconstruction of neural circuits, 
Frontiers in Neural Circuits).
